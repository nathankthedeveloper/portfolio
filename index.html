    			<h2>About me</h2>
		 		<p>After working for a non-profit organization for over ten years, I wanted to change my career in a different field. At first, I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I went back to college and got my Associate Applied Science degree in Information Technology. One day, I scrolled through my Facebook feed and saw the Engineering Flex program offered by Thinkful. I knew right away that this is the skill I want to learn, so I contacted Thinkful and enrolled in the program.</p>

		 		<p>I am a hard worker, detail-oriented, and a great team player. If you are looking for someone to hire, please feel free to contact me using my contact information below, and I would love to hear from you.</p>
				 <p>As much as I am passionate about coding, I also like to hang out with friends, go hiking, kayaking, and fishing whenever I have free time.</p>
