    			<h2>About me</h2>
		 	<p>After working for a non-profit organization over ten years, I decided that I want to change my career and do something else. At first, I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I went back to college and got my Associate Applied Science degree in Information Technology. One day, I scrolled through my Facebook feed and saw the Engineering Flex program, offered by Thinkful. I knew right away that this is the skill I want to learn, so I contacted Thinkful and enrolled in the program shortly after.</p>

		 	<p>I am a hard worker, detail-oriented, and a great team player. If you are looking for someone to hire, please feel free to reach out to me using my contact information below and I would love to hear from you.</p>
			 <p>Aside from being passionate about coding, I like to hang out with friends, go hiking, kayaking, and fishing.</p>
